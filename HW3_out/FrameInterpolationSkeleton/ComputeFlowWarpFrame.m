function warped_img = ComputeFlowWarpFrame(img0, img1, u0, v0, t)
% Use forward flow warping to compute an interpolated frame.
%
% INPUTS
% img0 - Array of size h x w x 3 containing pixel data for the starting
%        frame.
% img1 - Array of the same size as img0 containing pixel data for the
%        ending frame.
% u0 - Horizontal component of the optical flow from img0 to img1. In
%      particular, an array of size h x w where u0(y, x) is the horizontal
%      component of the optical flow at the pixel img0(y, x, :).
% v0 - Vertical component of the optical flow from img0 to img1. In
%      particular, an array of size h x w where v0(y, x) is the vertical
%      component of the optical flow at the pixel img0(y, x, :).
% t - Parameter in the range [0, 1] giving the point in time at
%     which to compute the interpolated frame. For example, 
%     t = 0 corresponds to img0, t = 1 corresponds to img1, and
%     t = 0.5 is equally spaced in time between img0 and img1.

% OUTPUTS
% img - Array of size h x w x 3 containing pixel data for the interpolated
% frame.
